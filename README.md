# THIS IS THE BACKUP BRANCH

## read me :)
this megaproject is my favorite one as it renovates an existing site and adds major improvements like a log in system and a recommendation system

## Extraction
- Download the project to your desktop either from releases (pick versions that don't have 1.x.0 or have the term backup on them OR download code to zip).
- We suggest using XAMPP, then put the folder inside the htdocs folder.
- Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP.
- Go to phpmyadmin, open a file explorer and go to /frontend/assets/sql.db and paste all the stuff in phpmyadmin to create the schema and tables.
- Type localhost in your browser.
